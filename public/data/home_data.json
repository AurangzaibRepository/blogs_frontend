        "description": "I am a self-employed software and web engineer dedicated to learning and teaching JavaScript for client-server architectures. After obtaining my Master's Degree in computer science, I gained experience from the startup world, where I used JavaScript intensively during both my professional life and spare time. Eventually it led me to teach others about these topics and to offer online courses and on-site consulting for companies. I am happy to welcome you on my website :-)"
