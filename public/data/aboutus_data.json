    "about": "Hi, it's Robin. I am a german software engineer and freelance developer from Berlin/Germany. First of all, thank you for reading my blog. It's such a pleasure to have you here!\n\nA couple of words about my professional life: I am a German software and web developer dedicated to learning and teaching JavaScript. After obtaining my Master's Degree in computer science, I gained experience from the startup world where I used JavaScript intensively during both my professional life and spare time. For a few years, I worked closely with an exceptional team of engineers at a company in Berlin, developing large-scale JavaScript applications, which eventually led to a desire to teach others about these topics.",
    "values_and_mission": "I try my best to have a positive impact on the world. 99% of my code is open source for everyone on GitHub. Every time I build a product/service for myself, I immediately think about how to open source it for others. Even though I open source my work and offer lots of learning material for free, not everyone is able to make use of it. Many people have no access to it because they didn't had the chance to learn the English language in the first place. That's why I try here and there to volunteer or to donate money to good causes. I have the strong believe that the major issue of diversity in our industry is due to inaccessible education for people outside of the western world. Apart from the language barrier, most educational content is too expensive. Whereas a programming course for $99 might be affordable in the US, it's out of reach for any eager programmer in South East Asia. I know that many programmers producing educational courses need to make a living, I am sitting in one boat with them, but there are options to make educational content affordable for others around the world too. After all, I hope that I can give something back by believing in these values and my mission to make education more accessible to everyone.",
    "passions": "Even though I do a lot of programming in my professional and spare time, there are other things I treasure too. I am an avid reader, but Iâ€™m always struggling to memorize my learnings. I guess, that's why I started to write down my notes of books I enjoyed to read. But it's difficult to keep up with all the books. Nowadays I often encourage people to read more, because it's such a fulfilling and meaningful activity.\n\nIn another life, I wanted to do music. But I avoided the stage at nightclubs when I got the first requests in my inbox. I preferred the anonymous internet over any stage. That's why I never revealed my identity back in the days and maybe that's why I never tried public speaking for conferences. Eventually, I decided to code and started to enjoy it too. Still, music is one reason why I am staying partly in Berlin. Nowhere else, I believe, will you find such a great selection of electronic music.\n\nThe most important part in my life is my girlfriend Liesa. Without her I wouldn't be able to sustain my every day doings. My life would be too chaotic. Every other week she is not at home, my working schedule shifts dramatically. She keeps my life in balance and is helpful in every part of it. You could argue that because of her I manage to stay sane. Alongside, she encourages me for workouts, eating healthy food and is always helpful when it comes to marketing for my professional stuff. Feel free to reach out to her for various topics around content marketing. She already works with a couple of great companies.",
    "support": {
        "description": "I invest a lot of my free time into this website. Several hours a working week and most of my weekend time. That way, I hope that I can help others to learn the things that I have learned by myself. But I cannot deny that it costs a lot of time and energy to keep the website up and running. As a return of investment, I get revenue from selling my courses and a little affiliate marketing, but that's nothing compared to the time and energy I put into it. Sometimes I wonder how much easier it would be to quit, but then my readers encourage me to keep going. I think it applies to everything in life: people have a big impact on this when they cheer you up.\n\nIf you appreciate what I am doing, there are several ways to support me. It keeps the educational content of mine up and running. Furthermore, it may help me to dedicate more time to teaching students. I already made the leap to being self-employed, but most of my time still goes into working with companies on their problems. If you like the content on my website and other projects I create, you can consider one of the following ways to support me with my adventure.",
        "follow_me": "First, you can encourage me by following me on my social media channels: Twitter, Facebook. There you will get only quality updates about my content. You can follow me as well on GitHub for trending, useful, or educational projects. In addition, you can subscribe to my Newsletter where many people already receive quality updates from me.",
        "leave_review": "Second, since I am writing educational books, my content began to end up on platforms such as Goodreads and Amazon. If you liked it, it would mean a lot to me if you would invest a couple of minutes to leave a rating or review. You can find my books on Goodreads and Amazon. It's one of my pillars to sustain my adventure to give out lots of content for free.",
        "share": "Third, I am grateful for every share on social media of my articles. When you read something on my website and find it valuable, please don't hesitate to share it. I am always eager to keep the quality of my articles on a high level and I always try my best to keep the content up to date.

        "learn_react": "Fourth, it encourages me when people learn React through my articles, eBooks or courses. It keeps me motivated to improve the material all the time. Even though the eBook is pay what you want, you can support me by paying for it. It helps me to take more time to update, improve and extend the material. A lot of people learned with my articles, books and courses and I encourage you to give it a shot as well. If you liked it, spread the word to your friends who want to learn it as well.",
        "contribute": "Fifth, you can have a direct impact yourself. Every of my articles has a link to the GitHub repository where I manage all of my content. You can open Issues or Pull Requests to improve the articles. It is not easy to keep everything up to date being all by myself. Additionally, it is not easy as a non native speaker.\n\nIn addition, you can write a guest blog post. Do you have an own website? Do you write quality content? Do you want to get more readers to your website? My website generates lots of traffic. You can help a lot of people in your topic of choice by teaching them. A guest blog post that links to your website is a great contribution. It has to relate to my content though.",
        "donate": "Last but not least, you can donate to support me. It is not time consuming, it is simple, and it is a one time donation. After all, it helps me to take time off to improve articles, to keep them up to date and to write more teaching material."
